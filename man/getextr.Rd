\title{Download distribution data, filter, and merge with climate or environmental}
\usage{
getextr(x, clim = clim, maxrec = 500, schema = "flat",
  rm.outlier = TRUE, alpha = 0.01, factor = 2, nmin = 5,
  parallel = FALSE, nclus = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A taxon name or list of taxon names. It is sometimes good to 
test these on the vegdistmod::get_gbif() function first.}

\item{clim}{A raster object of climate or other environmental data to extract from.}

\item{maxrec}{Maximum number of records to download.}

\item{schema}{To be passed to vegdistmod::extraction}

\item{rm.outlier}{To be passed to vegdistmod::extraction}

\item{alpha}{To be passed to vegdistmod::extraction}

\item{factor}{To be passed to vegdistmod::extraction}

\item{nmin}{To be passed to vegdistmod::extraction}

\item{parallel}{TRUE or FALSE. Should this be executed in parallel.}

\item{nclus}{If parallel == TRUE then how many cores should be used? Default is 4.}
}
\description{
getextr is a function that gets GBIF data and extracts climate or environmental 
data for each occurrence. This is a whole workflow for distribution 
data acquisition and value addition that draws on several other functions in vegdistmod
including gbif_get and extraction. Parallel option is useful for speeding up data collection for
many species when computational resources are available.
